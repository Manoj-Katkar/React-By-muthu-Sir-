/**
 * 
        * In React, controlled forms and uncontrolled forms refer to two different ways of managing form inputs and their values.

        **1. Controlled Forms
        In a controlled form, the form elements' values are controlled by React's state. Every time a user types something into an input field, the value of that input is stored in the component's state, and any change is reflected by updating the state.

        **Key Characteristics:
        The input value is stored in the componentâ€™s state.
        The state is the single source of truth for the form data.
        Every change triggers a re-render to update the state.



        **Benefits of Controlled Forms:
        Full control over form values.
        Easy to validate or format data in real-time.
        Synchronization between input and component state.
        **Downsides:
        Slightly more code and re-renders, which can be inefficient for large forms.
